# Multinomial Models
We conducted a survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk to gather data on salary and bank account balance levels for different demographics in the US; this information, in turn,  was used to develop four multinomial models that predict said levels on several sectors of the US population. These results are then aggregated to provide a distribution for the US-level responses, which are presented and compared against figures published elsewhere.
